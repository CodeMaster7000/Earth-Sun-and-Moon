# Earth, Sun & Moon

A simplistic earth, sun and moon diagram to illustrate the orbits of these 3 celestial bodies. The `turtle` module was used to create this Python program.

NOTE: Diagram not drawn to scale.

To view the animation, run `python3 Earth Sun & Moon.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3.
